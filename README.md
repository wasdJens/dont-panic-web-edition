# Dont Panic: Web Edition

![Cover](./_attachments/cover.png)

This is a handbook to introduce the basics of modern web development focused on JavaScript and the basics of client server architecures. The "handbook" is best used in a workshop setting (See [Getting Started](#getting-started)) but can also be used on your own or as reference material. I use the [Diàtaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework to provide a systematic approach to the learning materials.

## About

### Why a Handbook?
The handbook is inspired by my work over the last three years at the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg in Heidenheim, where I teach "Web Programmierung" to bachelor students. I love teaching, and over the years, multiple people have told me that they always liked how I teach certain topics. However, I didn't just want to print all my slides as a GitHub Repo. Instead, I wanted to try something new, something different.

I came up with the idea to create a type of handbook that can be used as learning material for solo learners but mainly as reference material for workshops to teach the basics of modern web development. With the handbook approach, I am not limited in how much detail I can go into in certain sections, which allows me to reuse the material for other workshops. It also provides a great tool for learners to decide on their own how deep they want to dive into the rabbit hole. I still recommend going over the material in a workshop-like setting because it is a lot better to learn in a group, and also the exercises are designed for 2-3 people.

### The downsides of typical "learning" approaches
Often, workshops are boring because someone is just presenting slide after slide, and then, maybe if you are lucky, you get some time to actually practice the skill that was just presented. I feel like this is the wrong approach simply because the mass of information you can present in a single workshop is massive. If you go by the speed of 1 slide per minute, a 60-minute workshop is about 60 slides of information without any practical exercises. I also strongly adhere to the principle of guiding people on how to arrive at a certain solution instead of just telling them what to do in order to solve problem X or Y.

- My workshop is centered around actually creating a new software product. Because exercises like calculating the sum of 2 numbers are way too boring, and I also want to teach some basics about Software Design, Software Engineering, and so on. It is also something each "student" can be proud of afterward because they will have created a (almost) fully functional software product.
- Most of the work is done by going over the tutorials provided here. If needed, the groups can check out the reference and how-to materials. This also improves the experience for students who already have a pretty solid understanding of certain topics and can go out and create their own software product, while new learners can go through the tutorials and learn the basics.
- It also allows me to actually help the groups and not present slide after slide while half of the course is already sleeping.

### Personal Motivation
I also wanted to finally try out the [Diàtaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework and their approach to technical knowledge. The handbook also offers me more freedom in creating different tutorials for different problems.

# Getting Started

The handbook itself can be used fully on your own with your own speed and time. But I recommend that the material is presented in a workshop setting with different groups because certain tasks are designed for 2-3 People and also interaction between each group. The goal of this workshop is that small groups (2-3 People) work on the problem described under the tutorial section the so called "ETUR Platform" a software product to manage customer reportings and bridge the gap between software developers and customers. All groups have access to the `reference` material and different `how-to` guides that explain the topics from the reference material. The goal for each group is to then bridge the knowledge in order to solve the issues described in the ETUR platform with their own approach. It is based on the concept: `The first rule of teaching: dont try to teach`

## Prequisites

See [SOFTWARE.md](./SOFTWARE.md) for a list of required software.

## How to Start

The best way to work through this handbook is to start with the Tutorial: [The Etur Platform](./tutorials/the-etur-platform/README.md) and follow each tutorial described there. If you cant solve a certain task refer to the [Reference](./reference/README.md) material and the [How to Guides](./how-to-guides/README.md).
