# Dont Panic: Web Edition

![Cover](./_attachments/cover.png)

This is a workshop to introduce the basics of modern web development focused on JavaScript and the basics of client server architecures. It is currently available only in German. The goal of this workshop is that small groups (2-3 People) work on the problem described under the tutorial section the so called "ETUR Platform" a software product to manage customer reportings and bridge the gap between software developers and customers. In order to solve these problems we use the [Diàtaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework to provide a systematic approach to the learning materials. All groups have access to the `reference` material and different `how-to` guides that explain the topics from the reference material. The goal for each group is to then bridge the knowledge in order to solve the issues described in the ETUR platform with their own approach. It is based on the concept: `The first rule of teaching: dont try to teach`

## About

The workshop is inspired by my work I have done the last three years for the Duale Hochschule Baden Württemberg in Heidenheim where I teach "Web Programmierung" for bachelor students. I love teaching and over the years multiple people gave me feedback that they always liked how I teach certain topics. But I didnt just want to print all of my slides as a GitHub Repo. Instead I wanted to try something new. Something different.

Often Workshops are boring because someone is just presenting slide after slide and then maybe if you are lucky you get some time to actual practice the skill that was just presented. I feel like this is the wrong approach simply because the mass of information you can present in a single workshop is massive. If you go by the speed of 1 slide per minute a 60 Minute workshop is about 60 Slides of Information without any practical exercises. I also strongly adhere the principle of guiding people how to get to a certain solution instead of just telling them what to do in order to solve problem x,y. For this reason over the winter holidays (2023) and the beginning of 2024 I sat down and thinked about a different approach how to structure this workshop.

I had already planned that I want to teach my lecture to all of our "Azubis" at PlanB. Gmbh (Btw we are still looking for awesome software developers so check out our career page if you can) and in the first thought process I just wanted to modify my slides and go with the same flow. But one issue that I encountered: My slides are created for around 33 Hours of teaching Hours. Which is quite a lot and way more time than I have in a three day workshop. Second from my students I also learned over the years that they really liked the practices they were able to solve in each lecture on their own where I presented a new topic and then gave them 15-30 minutes to practice the new skill. I also wanted to finally try out the [Diàtaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework and their approach to technical knowledge.

So I came up with the following idea: 

- The workshop is centered about actual creating a new software product. Because exercises like calculate the sum of 2 numbers is way to boring and I also want to teach some basics about Software Design, Software Engineering and so on. It is also something each "student" can be proud of afterwards because they will have created a (almost) fully functional software product.
- Most of the work is done by going over the tutorials provided here. If needed the groups can checkout the reference and how to materials. This also improves the experience for students who already have a pretty solid understanding of certain topics and can go out and create their own software product while new learners can go through the tutorials and learn the basics.
- It also allows me to actual help the groups and not present slide after slide while half of the course is already sleeping.

This is the basics. How it will go we will see. I will most likely present the results of each round somewhere here or on my LinkedIn so make sure to connect with me. I also love feedback so if you have any feel free to contact me.

## Changelog

See [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for a list of changes made to this workshop.

# Getting Started

The workshop itself can be used fully on your own with your own speed and time. But I recommend that the material is presented in a workshop setting with different groups because certain tasks are designed for 2-3 People and also interaction between each group. The first step however is to setup all Software components that are required to solve the tutorials.

## Prequisites

See [SOFTWARE.md](./SOFTWARE.md) for a list of required software.

## How to Start

The best way to work through this workshop is to start with the Tutorial: [The Etur Platform](./tutorials/the-etur-platform/README.md) and follow each tutorial described there. If you cant solve a certain task refer to the [Reference](./reference/README.md) material and the [How to Guides](./how-to-guides/README.md).
